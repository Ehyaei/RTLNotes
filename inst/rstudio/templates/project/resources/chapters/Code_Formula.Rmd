# Code and Formula

We can simply execute R codes among text in chunk contexts using RMakrdown. There are several possibilities in each chunk. Set `echo=TRUE`, for example, if you want to show the code.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

We can run inline R code `2^10=` `r 2^10`

## Math Formula

We can easily write math expressions by latex syntax. 
Inline LateX equations can be written in a pair of dollar signs

$$f\left(k\right)=\binom{n}{k}p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}$$
Also, we can write formulas by using dollar signs. For example, if we write `$\beta$` then we see $\beta$.
