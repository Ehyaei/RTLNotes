RMarkdown enables you to write reproducible academic publications such as articles, PhD thesis, lab reports, posters, presentations, and a variety of other fascinating documents using the lightweight and plain-text Markdown syntax.
There are several packages for RMarkdown themes, but all of them are useful for left-to-right languages.
RTLNotes package tries to create a right-to-left languages theme for RMarkdown.

> RTLNotes is not only for R users!. Python programmers can also run 
codes in Rmarkdown. This [article](https://ehyaei.github.io/MPIThemes/articles/articles/21_python_rmarkdown.html) has additional information.

When running your Rmd files with knitr, output plots, tables and code results are embedded in the md file. Then, Rstudio by using pandoc's powerful engine can convert your documents to many formats, such as PDF, Docx, HTML, epub, and... In particular, you can create PDF reports without worrying about the lateX code.
